First day of the library, will create look and outline what is needed.
Removed Prompts and added icons for trash, now I need to cause the ability to click on the trash to remove that book.
Experimented with ways to delete the div when clicking on the trash.
One way to get the value of the click is to run and index of? Then use that value to slice off the array. With the array gone, the div may still be there, need to also delete the div with the same number.
Can now delete books by trashCan, need to find a way to remove the DIVs still when a new book is added, and ensure ony pages are added. 
Have added the ability to remove divs by trashCan click, need to fix trashcan placement, add read ON and OFF by Click, can just be simply onClick change with change of color. 
Added the ability to change read status. For now, the project is finished, I would like to add memory and the ability to see book covers when clicked on later.
