First day of the library, will create look and outline what is needed.
Removed Prompts and added icons for trash, now I need to cause the ability to click on the trash to remove that book.
Experimented with ways to delete the div when clicking on the trash.
One way to get the value of the click is to run and index of? Then use that value to slice off the array. With the array gone, the div may still be there, need to also delete the div with the same number.
